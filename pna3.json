   "g_answer": "It's important to understand that anxiety is a normal human emotion, but when it becomes too intense and persistent, it can interfere with your daily life.

If you find that your anxiety is still interfering with your daily life, it may be helpful to consider seeking professional help. A licensed therapist can help you work through your anxiety and develop coping strategies that work for you.",
